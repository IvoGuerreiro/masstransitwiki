#MassTransitWiki

Welcome to timetableswiki, the aim of this project is to create a global comprehensive collection of timetables for public transportation around the world.

Our objective is to help the mobility and use of public transportation for traveling, business or any other purposes.

Timetablewiki is build with a spirit of sharing knowledge and information, if you are familiar with any public max transit system please fell free to update the wiki.

Timetableswiki is build with a software called Gollum that implements an wiki on the top of a GitHub repository, to edit this wiki you just need to create a GitHub account and edit the repository. If you are not familiar with Git please check our technical guides.
